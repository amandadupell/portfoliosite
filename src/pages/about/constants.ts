My interests in both coding and design allow me to study a range of topics across both disciplines. I am most curious accessibility, artificial intelligence, design systems, wireframing, prototyping, and user research. \n \nMy favorite book is The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto; my favorite movie is Kill Bill; my favorite color is orange; and my favorite type of pasta is penne alla vodka. On a normal day, you can find me reading the latest book recommendation, painting for fun, or arguing with my roommates over which movie we want to watch that night.';
