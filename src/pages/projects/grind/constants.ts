    SUMMARY: 'Due to COVID-19, we were faced with the problem of introducing our club to students virtually. Thus, a new idea was born: a newsletter and a personal, yet shared, journey to find the perfect cup of coffee while educating ourselves and our readers on what makes coffee ecologically, ethically and socially responsible.',
    PROCESS: 'Research was step number one. In order to brand and provide context for our club and newsletter, we read a number of articles and books on the history of coffee. From this, we were able to establish a modern, yet historic, take on the age-old drink. \n \n By using a select iconography and color palette, we allowed for a range of styles while remaining uniform across mediums. Our social media posts, actual newsletter and any marketing materials will have the same tone because of our established styleguide.',
    TYPOGRAPHY: 'Temeraire Display Black is the main font for this project because of its unique letterforms, specifically the loop and descender of the letter g. The loop reminded my friend and I of the shape and curves of a coffee bean. The smooth curves and accents were reminiscent of the smooth and boldness of a cup of coffee. It just made sense. ',
    COLOR: 'The color palette stems from multiple studies of different cups of coffee and the plant the beverage comes from itself. The majority of the palette is earth-toned and shades of brown. To accent and highlight these muted tones, we chose a dark green and vibrant orange to use as contrast. These colors also came from the study of the coffee plant and fruit.',
    LANGUAGE: 'Because our mission revolves around education and acitivism, we use direct language that addresses a problem and provides resources for our readers to learn more. Any posts, articles or graphics we share are properly cited and linked to the source. Overall, our tone is encouranging, informative and energetic; just like coffee.'
